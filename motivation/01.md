# What is consistency #

* shared memory distributed system
* how do reads relate to writes

!SLIDE bullets

# Motivation #

* physics
* CAP theorem
* concurrency control

!SLIDE bullets

# CAP #

* choose consistency or availability
* shades of grey

!SLIDE bullets

# Eventual Consistency #

* if writes stop, eventually reads return all writes

!SLIDE bullets

# examples #

* DNS
* asynchronous replication
* temporal caches (memcache, some HTTP)

!SLIDE bullets

# How do we Control? #

* formalize consistency
* logical time (not walltime)
* read-your-writes when you want it
* choose availability over consistency when you want

!SLIDE bullets

# No ACID #

* MVCC instead of transactions
* vector clocks
